# SafeMama Styling Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: App appears as unstyled HTML

If you see the SafeMama app displaying as plain HTML without any styling, this is a common Next.js caching issue. Here's how to fix it:

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

Run the automated fix script:
```bash
npm run fix-styling
```

Or use the clean dev command:
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

### Manual Fix

If the automated script doesn't work, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the development server**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where npm run dev is running
   ```

2. **Clear Next.js cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. **Clear node modules cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```

4. **Clear npm cache (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

5. **Restart the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Prevention

To prevent this issue from happening:

1. **Always stop the dev server properly** using Ctrl+C instead of closing the terminal
2. **Avoid force-killing the process** unless absolutely necessary
3. **Use the clean dev command** when you notice any styling issues:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

### Why This Happens

This issue occurs when:
- Next.js cache becomes corrupted
- CSS files are not properly served
- Build artifacts are inconsistent
- The development server is forcefully terminated

### Verification

After running the fix, verify the styling is working by:
1. Opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Checking that the app has proper colors, fonts, and layout
3. Ensuring the medication tracking system displays correctly

### Still Having Issues?

If the problem persists:
1. Try restarting your computer
2. Check if you have any browser extensions blocking CSS
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try opening the app in an incognito/private window
